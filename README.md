exploring news post types from the Hacker News site

This is a project from the Dataquest.io curriculum, which I've been enjoying thoroughly. If you are looking for implementation strategies for lists, dictionaries, and the datetime module, then this is a great project template--especially if you are scraping data from website posts.

Enjoy!
